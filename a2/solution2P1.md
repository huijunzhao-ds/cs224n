We put the proofs to questions in Problem 1 here. For the questions, please refer to __a2.pdf__ in this folder.

### a 

Note that 
- if $w=o$, $y_w=y_o=1$;
- otherwise, i.e., if $w\neq o$, $y_w=0$.

So

$$ -\sum_{w\in\text{Vocab}}y_w\log(\hat{y_w}) = -1\cdot \log(\hat{y_o} - \sum_{w\neq o}0\cdot \log(\hat{y_w}) = -\hat{y_w}$$

### b
